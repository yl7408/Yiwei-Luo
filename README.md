Software engineers tend to be in **more collaborative roles** in the workplace, while software developers may find themselves working in **a more independent environment**. Either of these careers may take place in an office workplace or remotely. People in these roles may work as company employees or independent contractors.

A software engineer may work with many different people on a team, including other engineers and developers. *Individuals working in this role may also work with users to determine software needs*.

Software developers work with other developers and programmers on a limited basis. *A lot of a developer's work involves working with applications or operating systems more than other people*. 

Both roles are **critical to the infrastructure of a company and their work affects the performance of software systems, applications, and network systems**.

### Comment by Frank Weng (fw2086)
Despite being an aspiring software developer, I did not know there was a difference between a software engineer and a software developer. It seems that engineers have a wider scope of things they need to be able to do. For the present I am still interested in becoming a developer, but in the future as I learn more skills, that may change.
